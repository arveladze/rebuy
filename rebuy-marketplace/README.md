# RebuyMarketplace

This project was generated using Angular version 20.

To start a local development server, run 'npm install' and 'ng serve'.

It is barely minimum mvp:

- a user can view a list of ordered offers and toggle sorting order,

- a user can see the details of a selected offer,

- a user can up/downvote offer,

- it gets mock data from hardcoded mockapi.io project url,

- it is somehow responsive,

- it uses bootstrap+icons which is easy to setup and gives minimal utilities,

- it validates fetched data with zod,

- it experiments with the view transition effect.

Honestly, it is garbage ;/
